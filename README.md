#Hello, I'm David - Welcome to my profile.

I'm a self-taught hobbyist programmer, trying to work towards becoming a career programmer. I like to see code as an artform that uses solutions instead of brushes. I'm more interested in lower-level computing, but find intrigue at layer.

My favorite projects so far:

- [Synthlib](https://github.com/synth-the-humanoid/synthlib)
- [KHMI](https://github.com/synth-the-humanoid/KingdomHeartsMemoryInterface)
- [CrazyComets](https://github.com/synth-the-humanoid/CrazyComets)
