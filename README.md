# Hello, I'm David - Welcome to my profile.

I'm a self-taught hobbyist programmer, trying to work towards becoming a career programmer. I like to see code as an artform that uses solutions instead of brushes. I'm more interested in lower-level computing, but find intrigue at each layer.

My favorite projects so far:

- [Synthlib](https://github.com/synth-the-humanoid/synthlib)
- [KHMI](https://github.com/synth-the-humanoid/KingdomHeartsMemoryInterface)
- [CrazyComets](https://github.com/synth-the-humanoid/CrazyComets)

I recently worked with a group on the [Pirate Software Game Jam 16](https://itch.io/jam/pirate). It's playable [here](https://synththehumanoid.itch.io/wet-william) and feel free to check the code [here](https://github.com/MushMello/WetWilly)

I also post on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@agorel) sometimes, mainly to do with hacking games and reverse engineering.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-browning-9746821a3/) as well!
